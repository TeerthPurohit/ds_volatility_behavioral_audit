📊 Data Science Submission — Trader Behavioral Analysis
Author: Teerth Purohit
Date: December 2025
________________________________________
📁 Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between market sentiment (Fear vs. Greed) and trading performance using real historical trade data and a Bitcoin sentiment index. The objective is to identify patterns in profitability, capital efficiency, trade timing, and directional edge (long vs short).
The analysis is implemented in Python using a Jupyter/Colab notebook, with reproducibility and data transparency in mind.

▶️ Running the Notebook
1.	Open notebook_1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, or Google Colab.
2.	Ensure the current working directory is set using:
import os
os.chdir('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/ds_Teerth_Purohit')
⚠️ If running locally:
You do not need to change directories as long as the folder structure remains the same.
3.	Run the notebook cells from top to bottom.
Summary tables will automatically be saved to /csv_files/ and charts saved to /outputs/.

📑 Data Sources & Notes
•	historical_data.csv contains trade-level execution data:
timestamp, direction (BUY/SELL), instrument, size (USD), fees, and realized PnL.
•	fear_greed_index.csv contains daily sentiment classification values:
Extreme Fear, Fear, Neutral, Greed, Extreme Greed.
•	Date alignment is performed using trade_date = date(timestamp).
This creates a clean one-to-many merge between sentiment and trade tables.
•	ROI is defined as:
ROI (%) = (Closed PnL / Position Size USD) * 100
________________________________________
📌 Outputs & Interpretation
The notebook produces:
•	pnl_vs_mood.png — average profit by sentiment
•	strategy_dashboard.png — ROI, Win Rate, Buy Ratio & Avg Trade Size by sentiment
•	time_analysis.png — volume and win rate by day & hour
•	psychology_check.png — long vs short performance & top assets
